# Eyes
Eyes shows you how to integrate **mouse events** into **javascript** and make some fun of it. You just have to *move your mouse* in a PC or *touch in different spots* when using tablets or phone and you will see the eyes balls follow the mouse position.

I hope you enjoy this as much as I did while coding it. :smile:
